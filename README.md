Automated Water Level Controller

Abstract: Developing an automated water level controller system utilizing Arduino, ultrasonic sensor, and MOSFET to maintain a consistent water level in a main tank by activating a pump from a secondary holding tank when levels drop.

Milestones:

Design and assemble hardware components: Arduino, ultrasonic sensor, LCD screen, MOSFET.
Code water level measurement using the ultrasonic sensor and LCD display.
Implement pump control logic to activate pump when water levels fall below threshold.
Transition pump control from relay to MOSFET for improved efficiency.
Integrate an on/off switch for system control and emergency shutdown.
Prototype assembly and placement of tanks and hardware.

Progress Update:

Hardware components assembled.
Code successfully measures water level and displays on LCD.
Pump control logic implemented and tested with relay.
Transition to MOSFET completed for improved efficiency.
Currently working on prototype assembly and tank selection.
Minor code adjustments to accommodate tank size expected in future.

Expected Output: Demonstrating a fully functional water level controller system with accurate measurement, LCD display, ultrasonic sensor utilization, and pump activation when required. Transition to MOSFET ensures enhanced efficiency and reliability"# Automatic-Water-Level-Controller"
